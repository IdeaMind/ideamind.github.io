## Who We Are



Idea Mind makes sure people are <strong>effective, safe, efficient, and empowered</strong> in the era of the Internet of Things by helping your company integrate new technologies or develop new and improved products. We specialize in wearable electronics, human-machine interfaces, low-power communication, and Internet of Things hardware/software.

The personal computer and world wide web have dominated the technology landscape for three decades, so much so that it has completely changed the processes, business practices, and skill mix of most technology companies. Today, companies are hurriedly applying these processes, practices and skills to a new age of computing devices and unfortunately, the results are not always pretty.

At Idea Mind, we emphasize taking a fresh look at engineering approaches for every problem. We first focus on forming an in-depth understanding of the problem, the stakeholders, the design constraints, the environment, and the user. We then develop the right solutions from the ground up, leveraging industry best practices wherever possible.
