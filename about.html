## Who We Are



Idea Mind makes sure people are <strong>effective, safe, efficient, and empowered</strong> in the era of the Internet of Things by helping your company integrate new technologies or develop new and improved products. We specialize in wearable electronics, human-machine interfaces, low-power communication, and Internet of Things hardware/software.

The personal computer and world wide web have dominated the technology landscape for three decades, so much so that it has completely changed the processes, business practices, and skill mix of most technology companies. Today, companies are hurriedly applying these processes, practices and skills to a new age of computing devices and unfortunately, the results are not always pretty.

At Idea Mind, we first focus on the user experience and then develop the right products from the ground up.
