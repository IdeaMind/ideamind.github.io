## Who We Are



Idea Mind makes sure people are <strong>effective, safe, efficient, and empowered</strong> by helping companies integrate new technologies or develop new and improved products. We specialize in wearable electronics, human-machine interfaces, low-power communication, and Internet of Things hardware/software.

The personal computer and world wide web have dominated the technology landscape for three decades. In order to stay competitive, most companies have adapted their processes, business practices, and personnel skill mix around these technologies.

Today, companies are once again adapting to a new computer paradigm of smart connected devices where most devices will not have the the traditional keyboard, mouse, monitor, or touchscreen that most systems are dependent on. Unfortunately, most engineering and software development firms lack experience in the the design and support of smart devices, and they try to solve their customers' problems with knowledge, tools, and methods that grew out their existing experience in IT, mobile development, or web development. The results are not always pretty.

At Idea Mind, Our niche is in making smart, connected devices work for your enterprise and your users. We have the specialized experience and track record to deliver valuable solutions that take advantage of new technologies and offer the usability and suitability that companies require for seamless integration. This experience includes the development and integration of safety critical and mission critical systems.

Our approach emphasizes taking a fresh look at all technical approaches to every problem. We first focus on forming an in-depth understanding of the problem, the stakeholders, the design constraints, the environment, and the user. We then develop the right solutions from the ground up, leveraging industry best practices wherever possible.
